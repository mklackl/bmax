| Phase | Focus | Key Agents |

| 2. Planning | Define the solution | Product Manager agent |
| 3. Solutioning | Design the architecture | Architect agent |
| 4. Implementation | Build it | Developer agent, then Ralph autonomous loop |

### Workflow

1. Work through Phases 1-3 using BMAD agents and workflows
2. For PRD creation, use \`_bmad/lite/create-prd.md\` for single-turn generation
3. Use the bmalph-implement transition to prepare Ralph format, then start Ralph`;
